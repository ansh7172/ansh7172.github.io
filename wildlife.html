				<p>Kenya is a country in East Africa with coastline on the 
				Indian Ocean. It encompasses savannah, lakelands, the 
				dramatic Great Rift Valley and mountain highlands. 
				It's also home to wildlife like lions, elephants and 
				rhinos. From Nairobi, the capital, safaris visit the
				Maasai Mara Reserve, known for its annual wildebeest 
				migrations, and Amboseli National Park, offering views 
				of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro. 
				</p>
				<p>The currency of Kenya is the Kenyan shilling. Kenya has a 
				number of national parks and game reserves that are popular 
				tourist destinations. Maasai Mara National Reserve is located in southwestern Kenya and is known 
				for the annual wildebeest migration. Visitors can see lions, 
				elephants, cheetahs, and other wildlife in their natural habitat.

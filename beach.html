				<p>The Maldives is a small island nation located in the Indian Ocean,
				southwest of India and Sri Lanka. It consists of 26 atolls, which are
				made up of more than 1,000 coral islands. With its turquoise blue waters,
				white sandy beaches, and stunning coral reefs, the Maldives is a popular 
				tourist destination known for its luxurious resorts, world-class scuba 
				diving, and water sports activities.</p>
				
				<p>The capital of the Maldives is Male. The official language is Dhivehi, 
				although English is widely spoken in tourist areas. Being an island nation,
				seafood is a staple in Maldivian cuisine, and coconut, rice, and various 
				spices are also commonly used in cooking.</p>
